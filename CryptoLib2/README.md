# CryptoLib2

This is a testing framework for Discript which provides zero knowledge circuits through Groth16. This project is heavily work-in-progress and is subject to change in the future. The base of this project will serve as the primitives used in Aurem's confidential proof-of-stake (CPoS) implementation.
